# Expedition Co. Take Home Assignment

## Instructions

We'd like you to implement this screen using HTML & CSS, taking a mobile-first approach.

For this task, don't worry about how the design will size up for tables and computers, just focus on making it work well on phones.

**What we're looking for:**

    - Clean, reusable, semantic markup.
    - Strong attention to detail (spacing, margins & padding, typography).

**Bonus points:**

    - Using the Google Maps Static API, replace the static map background image with a dynamically generated one instead.
